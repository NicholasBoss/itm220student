# IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR TEACHER/TA

# DO NOT PUBLISH THIS FILE FOR STUDENTS TO SEE!


# Setup
1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account. Only have one person do this (Teacher OR TA)
2. Add this file to the `.gitignore` file.
3. Uncomment all the weeks.
4. Have the students pull this repository `onto the Desktop` in their AWS instance by using the GitHub Desktop application or clone it onto their personal machine.
5. If students are on a local machine, have them run the root.py file to grant access to the databases needed for the course.
   * This will create a user and grant access to databases for the students to use.
   * On line 10, you may need to have the students change the password to their own password if on their local machine.

# Every Week
The TA/Teacher should update the `.gitignore` file to open up the files needed for each week. You do have the option to unlock the all the weeks at once, but it is recommended to only unlock the files for the current week. This will help keep the students focused on the current week's material.
* Please comment out the lines in the `.gitignore` file. This will allow the students to see the files needed for the week while keeping the code to hide the files from the repository.
* Have the students pull the repository to get access to the new files for the week.
